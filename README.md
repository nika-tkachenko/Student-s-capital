# Laptop Profit Calculation

This C++ program calculates the potential profit from selling laptops based on user inputs such as expected gains and prices, and then determines the final capital after making optimal purchase decisions.

## How to Use

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Enter the initial capital (`C`).
   - Define the maximum number of laptops (`N`) you're considering.
   - Specify how many laptops (`will_profit`) are in your list.

2. **Input Expected Profits and Prices:**
   - For each laptop in your list, input the expected profit from selling and its price.

3. **Calculate Net Profits:**
   - The program calculates net profit for each laptop and sorts them in descending order.

4. **Optimize Capital Utilization:**
   - It then optimizes the capital by purchasing laptops with the highest net profit until the maximum number or budget limit is reached.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it displays the final capital after all transactions.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler that supports C++11 or higher.
